        <p>
            TheIDE is an integrated development environment for the U++ cross-platform app development framework
            dedicated to the C++ programming language. It can handle general-purpose C/C++ projects as well.
            Additionally, it is an excellent IDE for people starting their journey with C/C++ programming and looking for an
            easy-to-use environment with features like a simple build system, code completion, code formatting, and debugger support.
        </p>

        <p>
            U++ is a C++ cross-platform rapid application development framework focused on programmers productivity.
            It includes a set of libraries (GUI, SQL, Network, etc.), and an integrated development environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rapid development is achieved by the smart and aggressive use of C++ rather than through fancy code generators.
            In this respect, U++ competes with popular scripting languages while preserving C/C++ runtime characteristics.
        </p>

        <p>
            The U++ integrated development environment, TheIDE, introduces modular concepts to C++ programming.
            It features BLITZ-build technology to speedup C++ rebuilds up to 4 times, Visual designers for U++ libraries, a Topic++ system for documenting code and creating rich text resources for applications (like help and code documentation) and Assist++ - a powerful C++ code analyzer that provides features like code completion, navigation and transformation.
        </p>

        <p>
            TheIDE can work with GCC, Clang, MinGW and Visual C++ and contains a full featured debugger.
            TheIDE can also be used to develop non-U++ applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            U++ supports following platforms on the production level: Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux &amp; FreeBSD.
        </p>
